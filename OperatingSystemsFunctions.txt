A function of Windows 10 is having icons on the task bar that are easy to locate and access. I will pin most of the programs I use to the task bar so that way I can click on them quickly when I need to open one. The task bar is wide enough that you could have quite a few icons on it. For example, I currently have the icons for the calculator, chrome, snipping tool, and office 365. I will probably add more as time goes on. 
Another operating system I use the most is Apple iOS. One function I use a lot is the App store on my iPhone. I have apps for fitness, social media, online shopping, and entertainment(home design games). Being able to easily download apps by clicking on the app store and searching an app is very convenient. I know I will only download more apps as I use my iPhone too.
