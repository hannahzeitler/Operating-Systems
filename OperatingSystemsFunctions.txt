A function of Windows 10 is having icons on the task bar that are easy to locate and access. I will pin most of the programs I use to the task bar so that way I can click on them quickly when I need to open one. The task bar is wide enough that you could have quite a few icons on it. For example, I currently have the icons for the calculator, chrome, snipping tool, and office 365. I will probably add more as time goes on.
